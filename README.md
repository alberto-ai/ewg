# Scrapping EWG Tap Water Database
Since 2010, water utilities' testing has found pollutants in Americans' tap water, according to an EWG drinking water quality analysis of 30 million state water records. The EWG Tap Water database can be consulted in their web.

It loooks like an interesting database so in this Python notebook I implement a process to scrap the database so it can be exported as CSV to further exploit this information.

The project also makes use of a ZIP database obtained from simplemaps.com which is used as the baseline to query all potential ZIP codes.
